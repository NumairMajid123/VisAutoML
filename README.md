# Getting Started

## Running the Web Application

### Frontend

To modify and run the React frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open your application in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Backend

To run the backend server:

```bash
cd backend
python manage.py runserver
```

This will start the Django development server at `http://localhost:8000`.

Make sure to have both the frontend and backend running simultaneously for the full application to work properly.
